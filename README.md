# Pusher .NET HTTP API library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-http-dotnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-http-dotnet)

This is a .NET library for interacting with the Pusher HTTP API.

Registering at <http://pusher.com> and use the application credentials within your app as shown below.

Comprehensive documenation can be found at <http://pusher.com/docs/>.

## Installation

### NuGet Package
```
Install-Package PusherServer
```

## How to use

### Constructor

```
var Pusher = new Pusher(APP_ID, APP_KEY, APP_SECRET);
```

### Publishing/Triggering events

To trigger an event on one or more channels use the trigger function.

#### A single channel

```
var result = pusher.Trigger( "channel-1", "test_event", new { message = "hello world" } );
```

#### Multiple channels

```
var result = pusher.Trigger( new string[]{ "channel-1", "channel-2" ], "test_event", new { message: "hello world" } );
```

### Excluding event recipients

In order to avoid the person that triggered the event also receiving it the `trigger` function can take an optional `ITriggerOptions` parameter which has a `SocketId` property. For more informaiton see: <http://pusher.com/docs/publisher_api_guide/publisher_excluding_recipients>.

```
var result = pusher.Trigger(channel, event, data, new TriggerOptions() { SocketId = "1234.56" } );
```

### Authenticating Private channels

To authorise your users to access private channels on Pusher, you can use the `Authenticate` function:

```
var auth = pusher.Authenticate( channelName, socketId );
var json = auth.ToJson();
```

The `json` can then be returned to the client which will then use it for validation of the subscription with Pusher.

For more information see: <http://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users>

### Authenticating Presence channels

Using presence channels is similar to private channels, but you can specify extra data to identify that particular user:

```
var channelData = new PresenceChannelData() {
	user_id: "unique_user_id",
	user_info: new {
	  name = "Phil Leggetter"
	  twitter_id = "@leggetter"
	}
};
var auth = pusher.Authenticate( channelName, socketId, channelData );
var json = auth.ToJson();
```

The `json` can then be returned to the client which will then use it for validation of the subscription with Pusher.

For more information see: <http://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users>

### Application State

It is possible to query the state of your Pusher application using the generic `Pusher.Get( resource )` method and overloads.

For full details see: <http://pusher.com/docs/rest_api>

#### List channels

You can get a list of channels that are present within your application:

```
IGetResult<ChannelsList> result = pusher.Get<ChannelsList>("/channels");
```

You can provide additional parameters to filter the list of channels that is returned.

```
IGetResult<ChannelsList> result = pusher.Get<ChannelsList>("/channels", new { filter_by_prefix = "presence-" } );
```

#### Fetch channel information

Retrive information about a single channel:

```
IGetResult<object> result = pusher.Get<object>("/channels/my_channel" );
```

*Note: `object` has been used above because as yet there isn't a defined class that the information can be serialized on to*

#### Fetch a list of users on a presence channel

Retrive a list of users that are on a presence channel:

```
IGetResult<object> result = pusher.Get<object>("/channels/presence-channel/users" );
```

*Note: `object` has been used above because as yet there isn't a defined class that the information can be serialized on to*

### WebHooks

Pusher will trigger WebHooks based on the settings you have for your application. You can consume these and use them
within your application as follows.

For more information see <https://pusher.com/docs/webhooks>.

```
// How you get these depends on the framework you're using

// HTTP_X_PUSHER_SIGNATURE from HTTP Header
var receivedSignature = "value";

// Body of HTTP request
var receivedBody = "value;

var pusher = new Pusher(...);
var webHook = pusher.ProcessWebHook(receivedSignature, receivedBody);
if(webHook.IsValid)
{
  // The WebHook validated
  // Dictionary<string,string>[]
  var events = webHook.Events;

  foreach(var webHookEvent in webHook.Events)
  {
    var eventType = webHookEvent["name"];
    var channelName = webHookEvent["channel"];

    // depending on the type of event (eventType)
    // there may be other values in the Dictionary<string,string>
  }

}
else {
  // Log the validation errors to work out what the problem is
  // webHook.ValidationErrors
}
```

## Development Notes

* Developed using Visual Studio Community 2013
* PusherServer acceptance tests depends on [PusherClient](https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-dotnet-client).

## Publish to NuGet

You should be familiar with [creating an publishing NuGet packages](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package).

From the `pusher-dotnet-server` directory:

1. Update `pusher-dotnet-server.nuspec` with new version number etc.
2. Run `package.cmd`
3. Run `tools/nuget.exe push Download/PusherServer.{VERSION}.nupkg'
